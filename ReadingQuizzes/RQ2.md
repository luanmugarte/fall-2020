1. The most widely used discrete choice model is:
    - GEV
    - probit
    - logit
    - mixed logit
    
    **A:** According to Kenneth Train, the most widely used discrete choice model is logit. 
    
2. List the three properties that the choice set in a discrete choice model must satisfy

    **A:** The three properties are: 1) the alternatives choices must be *mutually exclusive* from the decision maker's perspective; 2) the choice must be *exhaustive*, in the sense that all possible alternatives are included and the decision maker *must* choose one; and 3) the number of alternatives must be *finite*.

3. Describe the most common interpretation that is given to the distribution of ∆ê (epsilon)

    **A:** The most common interpretation for the distribution of $\varepsilon$ is that it's the distribution of the *unobserved* portion of utility within the the population of people who face the same *observed* portion of utility. This way, the probability $P_{ni}$ is the share of people who choose alternative $i$ within the population of people who face the same observe utility for each alternative as person $n$.

4. Assess the validity of the following claim: utility-maximizing behavior can be expressed by a random utility model (RUM), but not all RUMs express utility-maximizing behavior

    **A:** The claim above is valid, because although these types of models are consistent with utility maximization (as it were interpreted by Marschak (1960)), others kinds of behavior that *are not utility maximization* can be implemented in the RUMs. Utility-maximizing behavior does not exhaust the behaviors the decision makers can undertake.

5. Why do you think it is called a Random Utility Model?

    **A:** It's called Random Utility Model because it's a model that represents the utility faced by a decision maker between choices of different alternatives. The random part is inserted as the researches cannot observe the decision maker's utility, only some attributes of the alternatives presented to him. Therefore, the researcher must implement some term ($\varepsilon$) to the compensate the difference between the actual utility ($U$) faced by the decision maker and the representative utility ($V$) observed by her. The term $\varepsilon$  is treated as random, thus Random Utility Model.
